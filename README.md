# Tkinter
TKinter module for classwork 
Tkinter is a libary in python focused around a GUI interface, its extremely useful when used correctly and the code ive made only uses a part of it.
All imports are preinstalled in python so you don't need to install external packages.
any questions on how it works feel free to ask
